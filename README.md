## Description
Independently designed a social-based app for people who want to connect with their neighborhood communities and meet people in their area. Technologies used include MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to develop full CRUD capability. Employed React components to render information from a local API depending on user authentication.

## User Stories
User is able to create an account and join neighborhood groups and be able to view those on their profile. They can also create, edit, or delete groups. Some future approaches may include that the user can send messages to groups they have joined and be able to view other messages from other users.
